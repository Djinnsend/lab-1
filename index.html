        <h2>Nana Kofi Boakye </h2>
        <p> As is written above, my name is Nana Kofi Boakye, aged 20, and a student of Ashesi Campus. I am a Computer Engineering major, as of now. It is my dearest hope and ambition to graduate in 2022. Hopefully happily with a nice CGPA.Due to the fact
            that I dont really have much to say I shall mention sme stuff I find interesting about my self.<br/> </p>
        <h3> Interests:</h3>
        <ul type="square">
            <li> Games such as God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Apex Legends</li>
            <li> Fantasy Based stories, such as works of Peter V. Brett</li>
            <li> Anime such as AOT, OPM, GOH (Initials for the truest of weebs), Mob Psycho, One Piece, Re: Zero </li>
            <li> Movies, you know, famous stuff: Logan, Rush Hour (All 3), Matrix (All 3), etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Here, I will speak a bit about some aims; just one or two, to mention a few.</p>
        <h3> Aims:</h3>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Graduate, because bruh!! We need it. </li>
            <li>Hit 30 and be financially satisfied</li>
            <li>Build a school</li>
            <li>Make a streaming service and bring Anime merch to Africa (still verifying this)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Well thats that for now. Hope this gets me enough marks. I am a simple young man from Ghana, Kumasi and a proud one as to that. I aim to just be happy and hopefully make others happy as well. I have been summoned by the owner of my house, rather
            his house and so I leave. Should anyone read this, I am either DEAD or eating. DOesnt matter what time. Just call and you wil hear me make justice to some meal.
            <br/> Have a lovely rest of your day, and stay mighty blessed.</p>
        <br/>
