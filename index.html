            <p id="intro"> As is written above, my name is Nana Kofi Boakye, aged 20 and a student of Ashesi Campus graduating in 2022. I am a Computer Engineering major. I am a simple young man from Ghana, Kumasi and a proud one as to that. I aim to just be happy and
                hopefully make others happy as well through my actions. I am highly passionate and interested in Video games and Coding; thus i have the innate hope to either game or code my life away. I love animals, to travel and have respectful intellectual
                conversations.
